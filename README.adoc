== Overview

This is a sample application showing an example of using Cloudstate to build a Chat application in Node.js. The application consists of three services:

* A stateless service `chat`
* A stateful Entity based service `friends`
* A stateful CRDT based service `presence`

[[chatui-navigation-guide]]
The UI is designed to model a chat room where multiple users can connect/disconnect and exchanging chat messages. You simulate the chat room activities in one single browser window. This makes it easy to see the real time interactions, server-side pushes etc, without needing to open many browser tabs. Each user is a separate iframe with a separate websocket connection. The screen below shows the possible actions to interact with the UI.

== Code implementation

[horizontal]
chat-ui:: directory containing the code of the stateless service `chat`. This code is written in TypeScript, and run as a Node.js server.
deploy:: directory containing the yaml files to deploy all the services composing the Chat application. The target cluster could be your own Kubernetes cluster or https://www.cloudstate.com[Lightbend Cloudstate]

The code of the backend services `Friends` and `Presence` is separate from the UI code. This is intentional to demonstrate the polyglot aspect of Cloudstate services. They can seamlessly interact regardless of the programming language used to implement the service. Below are the available implementations. You can choose any combination for deployment. For example, `Friends` service in JavaScript and `Presence` service in Java.

=== JavaScript implementation

* https://github.com/cloudstateio/samples-js-chat/tree/master/friends[Friends service]
* https://github.com/cloudstateio/samples-js-chat/tree/master/presence[Presence service]

=== Java implementation

* https://github.com/cloudstateio/samples-java-chat/tree/master/friends[Friends service]
* https://github.com/cloudstateio/samples-java-chat/tree/master/presence[Presence service]


== Prerequisites

=== Deployment Tools

https://github.com/cloudstateio/samples-js-chat/blob/master/README.adoc#tool-prerequisites[Tools Prerequisites]

[[prereq-docker-registry]]
=== Docker repository

You must package your services into docker images and publish these images in a Docker registry. At deployment time, the Kubernetes cluster will pull the images from this registry. You can get a free Docker registry at https://hub.docker.com/


=== Self-hosting or Managed hosting?

For the deployment, there are two possible choices. Below we highlight the main characteristics of each deployment approach. Details about prerequisites and infrastructure preparation would be discussed further in the <<deployment,Deployment>> section. 

==== Managed hosting

This deployment approach doesn't require any local infrastructure. Lightbend Cloudstate, which is a kind of "Cloudstate-as-a-Service", will take care of the hosting, configuration and maintenance of your services. The deployment prodedure is pretty minimal:

* Open an account with Lightbend Cloudstate
* Install the "Cloudstate CLI" tool `csctl`

And that's it. Then you just use `csctl` to deploy the your services that you had published in your Docker registry.

 
==== Self-hosting

In case you prefer to host your own services, you need to provide a Kubernetes cluster. This cluster could be local or cloud-based and must fulfill the following requirements:

* A Kubernetes cluster, with 1.13 as the minimum required version
* An ingress controller with a Layer7 Load Balancer ability
* A working knowledge of Kubernetes to be able to manage your cluster and to troubleshoot, should any issue specific to your Kubernetes cluster arise.


== Build Docker images

Before beginning the deployment, each of the various microservices composing the Chat application must be packaged into their own docker image, and published to your Docker registry.

=== Building the Friends & Presence services
* https://github.com/cloudstateio/samples-js-chat/blob/master/friends/README.adoc#building-the-friends-service[Building the Friends service]

* https://github.com/cloudstateio/samples-js-chat/blob/master/presence/README.adoc#building-the-presence-service[Building the Presence service]

=== Building the Chat-UI service

The code below assumes that your Docker registry is named `mydockerregistry`. Please replace it with your own DockerID (which you might have registed at https://hub.docker.com/ as mentioned in <<prereq-docker-registry,Prerequisites - Docker repository>>


[source,shell]
----
cd ./chat-ui

# let's assume your DockerID in https://hub.docker.com/ is `mydockerregistry`
DOCKER_PUBLISH_TO=mydockerregistry

# build docker image
docker build . -t $DOCKER_PUBLISH_TO/samples-js-chat-ui:latest

# authenticate with your Docker registry
docker login

# push the docker image to your registry
docker push $DOCKER_PUBLISH_TO/samples-js-chat-ui:latest
----

=== Testing the Chat-UI service

To make the deployment of the Chat UI consistent with all the other services composing the Chat application, the Node.js server running the UI code is wrapped in a Cloudstate stateless service.

As such, the UI must be accessed via a Cloudstate proxy. The procedure is similar to that of https://github.com/cloudstateio/samples-js-chat/blob/master/friends/README.adoc#testing-friends-service[Testing Friends service].

* Edit https://github.com/cloudstateio/samples-ui-chat/blob/master/chat-ui/docker-compose.yaml[docker-compose.yaml] to replace the prebuilt image `cloudstateio/samples-js-chat-ui` by the docker image you have just published in the previous step.
* Start the docker images of both the Cloudstate proxy and the `chat-ui` service
* Access the Chat homepage via the Cloudstate proxy, which exposes the Chat-UI service on `http://localhost:9003/pages/chat.html`

[source,shell]
----
$ cd ./chat-ui
$ docker-compose up

# In a differwnt terminal: use curl (or a browser) to get the Chat-UI home page
curl --silent http://localhost:9003/pages/chat.html | grep -E "<title>.+"

# console output
<title>Cloudstate Chat Example</title>
----

NOTE: The test is successful if the Chat-UI returns an HTML page of the chat room home page. In case you opened the chat homepage in the browser. Please be aware that the Chat application itself is NOT YET fully functional. Because the supporting services `Friends` and `Presence` are not yet deployed.

[[deployment]]
== Deployment

We have built, tested and published 3 dockers images of the 3 services: Chat-UI, Friends, Presence. Now we are ready to deploy the Chat application. There are two possible tracks for deploying your services:

* <<docs/deploy-lightbend-cloudstate.adoc#,Deploy on Lightbend Cloudstate>>
* <<docs/deploy-self-hosted.adoc#,Deploy on your own Kubernetes cluster>>
